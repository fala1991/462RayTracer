Overview

In here you will find instructions for building the project and a
short description of each source file.

Building the Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the CMake build system (www.cmake.org). CMake is a kind of
"meta build-system," in that it creates a build system for you. It supports
many different build systems, ranging from Unix Makefiles to Visual Studio
projects to XCode projects.

1) If you don't have CMake installed, you should install it. If you're running
    Linux, it should be available through your disto's package manager
    (apt-get, pacman, ports, etc). Windows and OSX installers can be downloaded
    from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
2) Open up a command prompt in the "build" directory and run "cmake ../src".
    CMake will generate the build system in the build directory. By default,
    CMake will generate Makefiles on Linux and OSX and a Visual Studio project
    on Windows. If you'd like to change that, you can pass a different
    "generator" to cmake with the -G flag. A full list of generators can be
    found at the bottom of the output generated by running "cmake". For
    example, "cmake -G 'Xcode' ../src" will generate an Xcode project on OSX.
3) You can now use the build system in the "build" directory. The default
    target will compile everything for you, and the "install" target will copy
    the p2 executable to the main "p2" directory.

WINDOWS NOTE: If you're using Windows, you'll have to add the "windows/bin"
directory to your PATH environment variable so Windows can find the shared
libraries the project will use.

Running the Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:  <scene filename> [-n <numbers of samples per pixel>] [-m <skybox filename>] [-g <gloss effect value>]

<scene filename> is a .scene file in the scenes/ folder.
Instructions:

    Press 'r' to do the ray trace

    Right click at any object in the scene to focuse on it.
